I created first repository that it will get some thinks.
Undoubtedly, liberalism dominated the social, political and economic fields in the twentieth Century. But the implications of a simple experiment in the 21st century laboratory have shaken the heart of the liberal world view. Experiments tell us that there are at least two kinds of selves in the human body: experiencing self and narrating self. Life sciences have punctured liberal thinking that the so-called "free individual" is also a fictional story, that man is just a combination of biochemical algorithms. The next big separation is the beginning of decoupling of intelligence and consciousness. The so-called self is the mathematical model. But these models are very complicated and human minds can not understand them. We should "know ourselves" through data. It is true that everything is data and algorithms everywhere.
